# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

Considering this is my first project, there were moments when I had no clue of what I was doing if not were the guidance of the bootcamp course.

This is my first step into the tech industry, looking forward to learn new things and to make progress in my future projects once I finish my bootcamp studies and gain more experiences in the long term.
